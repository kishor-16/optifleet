# 🚚 OptiFleet - SIMPLE START GUIDE

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

You're running `npm run dev` which starts the **wrong server** (MERN stack with MongoDB).

You need to run the **simple backend server** instead.

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION (2 Options)

### Option 1: Double-Click This File ⭐ EASIEST
```
RUN_ME.bat
```
Just double-click `RUN_ME.bat` in the project folder!

### Option 2: Manual Command
```bash
cd c:\Desktop\kishor\optifleet
node backend/server.js
```

---

## 🌐 THEN OPEN BROWSER

Go to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard.html**

---

## 🧪 TEST IT

1. Click **"Load Sample"**
2. Click **"Optimize Routes"**
3. Wait 2-3 seconds
4. See results with **25-35% savings**!

---

## ❌ STOP DOING THIS

```bash
npm run dev          # ← WRONG! Don't use this!
cd backend
npm run dev          # ← WRONG! Don't use this!
cd frontend
npm run dev          # ← WRONG! Don't use this!
```

---

## ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD

```bash
node backend/server.js    # ← CORRECT! Use this!
```

Or just double-click: **RUN_ME.bat**

---

## 📊 Expected Results

**Before Optimization:**
- Distance: ~68 km
- Fuel: ~8 L
- CO₂: ~22 kg

**After Optimization:**
- Distance: ~47 km
- Fuel: ~6 L
- CO₂: ~15 kg

**Savings: ~31%** ✅

---

## 🐛 Still Not Working?

1. **Close ALL terminal windows**
2. **Double-click `RUN_ME.bat`**
3. **Wait for "Ready to optimize routes" message**
4. **Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard.html**

---

## 📁 Important Files

- **RUN_ME.bat** ⭐ - One-click startup (USE THIS!)
- **CORRECT_COMMANDS.md** - Detailed explanation
- **backend/server.js** - The actual server
- **frontend/dashboard.html** - The dashboard

---

## 💡 Why This Happens

- `npm run dev` tries to start MERN stack (MongoDB + React)
- You don't have MongoDB installed
- You don't need MERN stack for this project
- You just need the simple Node.js backend

---

## 🎉 Success = Different Before/After Values!

If before and after are the SAME, the server isn't running correctly.

If before and after are DIFFERENT with ~30% savings, **IT'S WORKING!** ✅

---

**Just use `RUN_ME.bat` and it will work!** 🚀
